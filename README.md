## Screenshots

Here we can see a few screenshots of the working of the dictionary program. We can see the program searching for a word, adding a word along with its meaning and also deleting a word.

  <br />This is the loading screen of the program. (Note: The program doesn't really need loading time but implementing this seemed an interesting idea)

<details><summary>Main Menu</summary>

  <br />This is the home screen or main menu of the program. From here we can select any of the listed options.

<details><summary>Word Search</summary>
  
  ![plot](assets/search_success.jpg)
  <br />Here we have searched for the word 'the'. The search was successful and the program has also shown the suggested words after searching.

</details>

<details><summary>Delete Word</summary>
  
  ![plot](assets/deletion_fail.jpg)
  <br />Here, we have tried to delete the word 'hello'. However, as this word did not exist in the database, the deletion procedure fails.
  
</details>

<details><summary>Add Word</summary>
  
  ![plot](assets/add_word.jpg)
  <br />Here, we successfully add the word hello along with its meaning to our database. We can check if the word has been added properly by searching for it again as follows:
  
  ![plot](assets/search_hello.jpg)
  <br />As we can see, the search for 'hello' now works.
